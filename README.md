# modClass_heat_diffusion
modeling class heat diffusion codes
January 2016, Charlie Shobe

First assignment, week 1:
analytical solution for linear profile
analytical solution for sinusoidally forced profile

Second assignment, week 2:
Backward Euler thermal profile model
Model with two forcing options and comparison with borehole data

HI JESS: The file you want is called shobe_thermal_profile.py, and
the borehole data file cape_thompson.dat needs to be in the same
folder you rn the script from. Thanks! -Charlie
